# Beta Versions: Transition to Final Version

## Overview

This document outlines the development journey of the project through its beta phases, culminating in the final version. Each beta version introduced significant advancements, improving the system's capabilities for dyslexia detection and analysis. While certain features, such as **NLP-based anomaly detection**, remain a work in progress, the system has matured into a robust diagnostic tool.

## Beta Version 1: Early Stage Development

The first iteration laid the foundation by focusing on simple character classification using a **Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP)** model. It explored basic feature development and provided initial feedback for system testing.

### Key Features
- **Character Classification with MLP:** A basic MLP model to classify individual handwritten characters.
- **Initial Image Preprocessing:** Simple image extraction techniques to isolate characters for analysis.
- **Basic Reporting:** Displayed character classification results based on user-uploaded images.

## Beta Version 2: Enhanced Dyslexia Detection

The second version improved upon the initial design by introducing **Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs)** for better accuracy and feature extraction. This version focused on identifying dyslexic patterns such as letter reversals.

### Key Features
- **CNN-Based Classification:** Transitioned to CNN models for enhanced character recognition.
- **Improved Dyslexia Detection:** Distinguished between "Normal" and "Reversal" character patterns.
- **Image Preprocessing Refinements:** Optimized image resizing and segmentation for more accurate input data.
