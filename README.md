# Dyslexia Accessibility NLP Project

## Overview

This project provides an integrated solution for detecting and addressing dyslexia through **Machine Learning (ML)** and **Natural Language Processing (NLP)**. It leverages state-of-the-art techniques to analyze handwriting and textual input for dyslexic patterns, enabling early diagnosis and accessibility improvements.

Key features include handwriting analysis using **Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs)** and **Multi-Layer Perceptrons (MLPs)**, as well as anomaly detection in written text through advanced NLP models. The system is complemented by a user-friendly web interface for seamless interaction and reporting.

## Key Features

### 1. **Handwriting Classification**
- CNN-based models identify handwritten characters and detect patterns such as reversals, omissions, or misalignments indicative of dyslexia.

### 2. **Dyslexia Detection**
- Combines MLP-based character classification with CNN-driven letter pattern recognition to identify dyslexic tendencies.
- Generates detailed analysis reports for educators and professionals.

### 3. **Sequence Anomaly Detection with NLP (work in progress)**
- NLP models trained to recognize textual sequence anomalies, aiding in the analysis of dyslexic writing patterns.
- Includes LSTM-based models.

### 4. **Interactive User Interface**
- A **Flask**-powered web application for uploading handwriting samples or text inputs.
- Displays real-time analysis results with downloadable PDF reports.

## Dataset

This project utilizes a variety of datasets designed for handwriting analysis and dyslexia detection:

1. **EMNIST Dataset**  
   - An extension of the MNIST dataset, comprising 814,255 images of handwritten digits and letters across 62 classes.  
   - Widely used for handwriting anomaly detection, particularly in uppercase and lowercase letters.

2. **NIST Special Database 19**  
   - A large dataset of handwritten characters collected from over 500 writers.  
   - Forms the foundation for MNIST and EMNIST, supporting advanced optical character recognition (OCR) tasks.

3. **Dyslexia-Specific Handwriting Samples**  
   - Datasets focused on dyslexic writing patterns, including mirrored letters, reversals, and omissions.  
   - Collected from primary school children and used in studies employing CNN and SVM models for dyslexia detection.
