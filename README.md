# Dyslexia Accessibility NLP Project

## Overview

This project provides an integrated solution for detecting and addressing dyslexia through **Machine Learning (ML)** and **Natural Language Processing (NLP)**. It leverages state-of-the-art techniques to analyze handwriting and textual input for dyslexic patterns, enabling early diagnosis and accessibility improvements.

Key features include handwriting analysis using **Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs)** and **Multi-Layer Perceptrons (MLPs)**, as well as anomaly detection in written text through advanced NLP models. The system is complemented by a user-friendly web interface for seamless interaction and reporting.

## Key Features

### 1. **Handwriting Classification**
- CNN-based models identify handwritten characters and detect patterns such as reversals, omissions, or misalignments indicative of dyslexia.

### 2. **Dyslexia Detection**
- Combines MLP-based character classification with CNN-driven letter pattern recognition to identify dyslexic tendencies.
- Generates detailed analysis reports for educators and professionals.

### 3. **Sequence Anomaly Detection with NLP**
- NLP models trained to recognize textual sequence anomalies, aiding in the analysis of dyslexic writing patterns.
- Includes LSTM-based models (work in progress).

### 4. **Interactive User Interface**
- A **Flask**-powered web application for uploading handwriting samples or text inputs.
- Displays real-time analysis results with downloadable PDF reports.
